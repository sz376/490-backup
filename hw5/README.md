# tweepy_test

This program will search for tweets within the last 30 days for a user and print them out in the terminal.

### Dependencies

To access the Twitter API, I used Tweepy v3.9.0.

### Running the script

```
python tweepytest.py kanyewest
```

The script will run until all tweets within 30 days have been found.
